Information about `apt-get`, `dpkg`, `aptitude`, Ubuntu official repositories, PPAs and related concepts.

#Source types

The following are the major sources of software:

- Main
- Restricted
- Universe
- Multiverse
- Partner
- PPAs

The difference between Main, Universe, Restricted and Multiverse can be visualized as:

|             | Free software | Non-free software |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Supported   | Main          | Restricted        |
| Unsupported | Universe      | Multiverse        |

The list of all above packages can be found at: <http://packages.ubuntu.com/>

In addition, there are also the `partner` sources.

On new installs, Main and Restricted sources are enabled by default.

By default, only Main sources are enabled. Enable Universe with:

    sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) universe" 

Enable everything with:

    sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main universe restricted multiverse"
    sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) partner"

PPAs vs Universe: universe passes some selection form Canonical, PPAs don't.

##Pre-installed

List of pre-installed packages perversion: <http://askubuntu.com/questions/50077/how-to-get-a-list-of-preinstalled-packages>

Current 12.04.4 was at <http://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/ubuntu-12.04.4-desktop-i386.manifest> but may be removed once a new one comes.

##Main

Officially supported software. Full list for 12.04 + their recommendations + the files they provide: <http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/allpackages>. Not possible to see the file contents.

Not all of those packages come pre-installed, they can be installed directly with `apt-get` since their source is already enabled by default.

##Partner

Support is not given by Canonical, but by the company who produces the software.

Notable examples: Flash, Skype.

<http://askubuntu.com/questions/456345/what-is-the-difference-between-multiverse-and-partner-sources>

Enable:

    sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) partner"

#Software version

For stability and QA, there is only a fixed version of each software per Ubuntu version, except for occasional:

- updates
- security
- backports

updates. Those updates normally only touch critical components, and even after an update it is still possible that a more recent version of Ubuntu will have a more recent version of the software.

Therefore, the most flexible way of getting updated version of software are PPAs.

##Security

Hot-fixes that must be updated quickly.

##Updates

Simply updates, not yet in another version.

Enabled by default.

##Proposed

Proposed for updates, but not yet tested.

Disabled by default.

##Backports

Updates that come from a new release and were enabled to older systems.

Enabled by default.

#Metapackages

Metapackages are packages that contain no source code of their own, but have several dependencies

They serve as a collection of software that is useful when installed together.

Examples: `texlive-full` (*lots* ot latex packages), several desktop environments, etc.

It seems that `dpkg` without additional info has no way to tell the difference between packages installed as dependencies of a metadata and packages explicitly installed: it is as if you had written if all by yourself on the command line.

It seems that aptitude can store this information, and uninstall metapackages in one go: *major* reason for using aptitude!

There seems to be no way of telling

#Transitional packages

TODO <http://askubuntu.com/questions/20377/what-exact-purpose-have-transitional-packages>

#dev packages

Are packages that contain libraries to build stuff, typically `.h` and `.so` files

Their names are typically of the type, `libXXX-dev`, e.g.

	libvbr-dev

Of just with the `-dev` suffix:

	nvidia-cuda-dev

#apt-get vs aptitude vs synaptic

Summary: **always** use `aptitude` instead of `apt-get`!

Reason: on remove aptitude removes all dependencies which were not installed explicitly But apt-get does not. Example: you installed package a, with 50 dependencies d1, d2, etc. which were not installed. If you do `apt-get unsinstall a`, the deps stay, and you have to do `apt-get uninstall d1, d2, ...`, but if you installed with `aptitude`, and you do `aptitude unistall`, D1 .. d50 are all removed.

*it seems that* apt-get aptitude, and synaptic are front-ends for dpkg. Therefore they should be compatible.

Synaptic has a GUI interface, but less options.

Aptitude seems to be more powerful than apt-get

#PPA

PPAs are sources of software.

To add a new source you must do two things:

- add the PPA key to the trusted PPA list
- add the PPA to the PPA list

##Find PPAs

Launchpad <https://launchpad.net> is the main source for PPAs and the site is maintained by Ubuntu. Look there first.

Next Google it.

##List PPAs

Default sources:

    cat /etc/apt/sources.list

PPAs:

    ls -1 /etc/apt/sources.list.d/

##Keys

In order to trust a PPA, you have to add its key.

This is called a *digital signature*.

It is meant to ensure that:

- you received the data from who you think you did
- the data was not modified in its way to you

Keys are managed by GPG, and kept in:

	gpg /etc/apt/trustdb.gpg

So if you want to really understand things, you must first understand gpg

List keys easily:

    apt-key list

add keys:

    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 5044912E

`wget`:

    wget -q -O - http://archive.getdeb.net/getdeb-archive.key | sudo apt-key add -

##add-apt-repository

Add key to PPAs in Launchpad.

`python-software-properties` package.

Launchpad is maintained by Canonical, and it is easy to Install/remove packages from them with `add-apt-repository`.

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deluge-team/ppa
    sudo aptitude update

    - `deluge-team` is an username
    - ppa is an specific ppa from that username

`-y`: don't ask for confirmation:

    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:user/repo

Remove sources:

You could remove them manually, but there it is better to do that with `ppa-purge`:

    sudo aptitude install ppa-purge
    sudo ppa-purge ppa:matthaeus123/mrw-gimp-svn

Not sure what is the weight of:

    sudo add-apt-repository --remote

##PPAs outside launchpad

The best I could find for now to add was the GetDeb way:

    wget -q -O - http://archive.getdeb.net/getdeb-archive.key | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu quantal-getdeb games" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/getdeb.list'

And to remove:

    sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/getdeb.list
    apt-key list | less
    Pub   4096R/46D7E7CF 2009-05-15
    ^^^^^^^^
    KEY
    KEY=
    sudo apt-key del "$KEY"

Keep a list of all PPAs added like this somewhere.

If you want to uninstall, you will remember the filename to remove.

#dpkg

Info on installed packages.

List all installed packages and greps for `foo`:

	dpkg -l | grep $EXPRESSION

The first two letters mean:

- `ii`: installed
- `rc`: configuration files only (`rc` means config such as in `bashRC`)

List files in installed package

	dpkg -L mysql

Install `.deb` file:

	dpkg -i a.deb

new packages ##apt-cache

Searches package name and descriptions on the web:

    apt-cache search "$PATTERN"

Pattern is a POSIX ERE.

#apt-file

Search for and list package files. **very** useful to know: which package provides a missing file like a `bin/name` or `include/name.h`?

    sudo aptitude install apt-file
    apt-file update
    f=

##search

Search for file "$F" in packages.

    apt-file search "$f"

Literal full path substring match

Use Perl regex:

    apt-file search -x "a.c"

Combo: search for an executable called `a2x`:

    apt-file search bin/a2x

##Show

Shows files in package `p`:

    p=
    apt-file show "$p"

##Get info on packages before installing them

List package dependencies

    apt-cache depends $PKG

Find who depends on $PKG (reverse dependencies):

    sudo apt-rdepends -r $PKG

Get basic information about a package:

    apt-cache show $PKG

Get detailed information about a package:

    apt-cache showpkg $PKG

    sudo aptitude install debtags
    debtags tag ls $PKG

Package naming conventions:

    -dev:  headers and libs, no docs
    -doc:  documentation
    -test: tests

#aptitude

#First time usage

Before you do anything else, do:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install aptitude

###Proxy

Setup connexion through a proxy via:

    sudo vim /etc/apt/apt.conf

Add line:

    Acquire::http::Proxy "http://proxy.server.here:port/";

##update

Looks for possible updgrades on known sources, but does not install them:

	sudo aptitude update

Meaning of output: TODO

    Hit http://fr.archive.ubuntu.com precise Release.gpg
    Hit http://fr.archive.ubuntu.com precise-updates Release.gpg
    Hit http://fr.archive.ubuntu.com precise-backports Release.gpg
    Hit http://security.ubuntu.com precise-security Release.gpg
    Ign http://archive.canonical.com precise/partner TranslationIndex

##install

Install package

    sudo aptitude install $PKG

Also installs recommended packages

    sudo aptitude install -o APT::Install-Recommends="true" $PKGg

    -o option changes things which could be in the config files.

Also installs suggested packages

    sudo aptitude install -o APT::Install-Suggests="true" $PKGg

Install only the dependencies required for a package but not the package itself:

    sudo aptitude build-dep $PKG

This is useful if you want to dev a package that has compiled dependencies.

Install specific version of a package:

    sudo apt-get install apache2=2.2.20-1ubuntu1

Very likely to clash with other installed versions of the package.

It is not simple to install to current user without root: <http://askubuntu.com/questions/339/how-can-i-install-a-package-without-root-access>

##build-deps

Install build dependencies for a package.

    sudo aptitude build-deps $PKG

##upgrade installed packages

Move to next version

Upgrade a single package:

    sudo apt-get -u install $PKG

Upgrades all packages for which upgrade does not involve installing more packages

    sudo apt-get -u upgrade

Upgrades all packages, even if upgrade requires installation of new packages

    sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

##remove packages

    sudo apt-get remove $PKG

Remove package but leave configuration files:

    sudo aptitude remove $PKG

Remove package and configuration files:

    sudo apt-get purge $PKG
    sudo aptitude purge $PKG

Removes dependencies which you did not install explicitly (didn't write on the command line yourself) and that are no longer necessary. Always follows remove or purge. `dpkg` then must contain information about what you installed yourself or not.

    sudo apt-get autoremove

Does nothing for packages that come from metapackages, which are treated as if you had manually installed them. This is where `aptitude` comes in!

TODO:

    sudo apt-get autoclean

    sudo apt-get clean

##build-dep

Install all build dependencies for a package.

Great when you are going to compile it from source to get the latest version.

    sudo apt-get build-dep $PKG

#combos

To correct dependency problems try:

    PKG=gimp
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get purge $PKG
    sudo apt-get autoremove
    sudo apt-get autoclean
    sudo apt-get clean
    sudo apt-get autoremove
    suto apt-get install $PKG
    Also, if the package comes from a ppa, remove the ppa and try again
    Sources list. does not include ppas

#Create packages

TODO! Someday ill get to the point of having something useful to package too myself... And then I'll learn this! =)
