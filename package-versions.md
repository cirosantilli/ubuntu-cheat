# Package versions

For stability and QA, there is only a fixed version of each software per Ubuntu version, except for occasional:

- updates
- security
- backports

updates. Those updates normally only touch critical components, and even after an update it is still possible that a more recent version of Ubuntu will have a more recent version of the software.

Therefore, the most flexible way of getting updated version of software are PPAs.

## Security

Hot-fixes that must be updated quickly.

## Updates

Simply updates, not yet in another version.

Enabled by default.

## Proposed

Proposed for updates, but not yet tested.

Disabled by default.

## Backports

Updates that come from a new release and were enabled to older systems.

Enabled by default.
