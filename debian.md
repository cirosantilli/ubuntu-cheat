# Debian

Ubuntu is a Debian based distribution.

Ubuntu is maintained by the company Canonical, while Debian is managed by the community.

Important implications:

-   many key package manager programs are the same:

    - `dpkg` for packages
    - `upstart` for init

-   special directories conventions are the same:

    - `/media` for mounting
